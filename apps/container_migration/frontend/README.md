# Container Migration Application

This project consists of a FastAPI backend and an Angular frontend.

## Quick Start

### Backend (FastAPI)
1. Navigate to the backend directory: `cd ../backend/`
2. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Start the backend server: `python3 main.py`
4. Backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend (Angular)
1. Navigate to the frontend directory (this directory)
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `ng serve`
4. Frontend will be available at `http://localhost:4200`

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.11.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
